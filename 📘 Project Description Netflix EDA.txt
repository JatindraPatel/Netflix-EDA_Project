📘 Project Description: Netflix EDA

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover meaningful insights about global content trends, genres, ratings, production countries, and release patterns.

Using Python data-analysis tools, the project cleans, visualizes, and interprets the dataset to answer important questions such as:

What type of content does Netflix produce more—Movies or TV Shows?

Which countries contribute the highest number of titles?

What ratings are most common on the platform?

How has Netflix content grown over the years?

Which genres dominate the platform?

The project aims to help data enthusiasts understand the structure of the dataset, analyze industry trends, and practice real-world data exploration workflows.

It includes:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values

Feature Exploration

Data Visualization

Insight Reporting

This repository serves as a great reference for beginners and intermediates learning Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, while also practicing practical EDA on a popular real-world dataset.
